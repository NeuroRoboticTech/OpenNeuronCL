1. Checkout the repo from https://xp-dev.com/svn/OpenNeuronCL/trunk using SVN.
You must place this in the AnimatLabSDK folder at the same level as AnimatPublicSource.
Eventually, it will be part of the regular sdk as well, and other parts of animatlab will use it.

2. Download boost and install it. 
http://www.boostpro.com/download/
BoostPro 1.51.0

3. Make sure you have the BOOST_ROOT environment var, and that it is pointing to your boost install dir.
C:\Program Files\boost\boost_1_51
for me.

4. If you have nVidia then download and install the following opencl drivers.
https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-42-archive
NOTE: Do NOT try to use cuda 5. At least at the time I wrote this it did not have
the necessary opencl tools. Instead, use 4.2 from the link above.
Install the toolkit, drivers, and sdk.

5. load the OpenNeuronCL/OpenNeuronCL.sln solution and try to compile it. 
To debug it you need to set the OpenNeuronCL_ConsoleTest to be the startup application.
To run/debug the unit tests you need OpenNeuronCL_UnitTests to be the startup.
